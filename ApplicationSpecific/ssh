Generating keys for public/private key auth
- Using a client (your PC) and server (rpi), trying to access server securely

On Server:
mkdir ~/.ssh
vim authorized_keys
	- paste client's public key (see below)
sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart
-or-
sudo reboot

On client:
generate new ssh key:
	ssh-keygen -t rsa -C 'someKnownIdentifier' (hostname seems good)
Keep the not .pub one
Copy public key to server
Append to 'authorized_keys' on server using:
	cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh <USERNAME>@<IP-ADDRESS> 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'

Secure the server by disabling password auth:
vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
PasswordAuthentication no
<restart ssh>
