Notes of shit from hackrf vids because rewatching is stupid

## LESSON 1 ##

Sources::OsmocomSource
	Turn down 'Ch0: RF Gain (dB)' = 0 // not needed
	IQ Balance mode: off // just bc this way in vid

Instrumentation::WX::WX GUI FFT Sink
	Averaging = off is nicer to see



basic radio tut:

multiply shift shit away from dc spike etc

but channel width is important to use less cpu for much lower bandwith signal
coming out of low pass filter
	- width of FM station is 200k
	- set decimation to this sample rate in low pass since
		we don't need all this BW. Note needs type int
Add rational resampler to adjust the sample rate by nonint value

WBFM
Quadrature Rate - sample rate of input
Audio Decimation - Amount to decimate to get to audio sample rate

NOTE: THIS PROGRAM IS SHIT, 5e6/25*(12/5) != 400k, is 480k
EDIT: Since used ints it rounds. ALWAYS PUT DECIMAL WITH GRC

## End lesson 1 ##
