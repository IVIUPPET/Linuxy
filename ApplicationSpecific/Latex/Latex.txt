Latex stuff

apt install texlive
Alt:
apt install texlive-full (huge but avoids some headaches as no package manager for dependencies)

Basic: Generate PDF from tex:
pdflatex docName.tex

Going from reddit:
apt install rubber (v1.4 at this time)

use mupdf
apt install mupdf

add this shit to .vimrc or ftplugin/tex.vim
" LaTeX (rubber) macro for compiling
nnoremap <leader>c :w<CR>:!rubber --pdf --warn all %<CR>

" View PDF macro; '%:r' is current file's root (base) name.
nnoremap <leader>v :!mupdf %:r.pdf &<CR><CR>

Now just use \c and \v to compile and refresh!


Seems also need:
gh/hplgit/ptex2tex.git

LaTeX style files are located in:
    /home/username/miniconda3/envs/docOnce/share/texmf/tex/latex/ptex2tex
    Please make sure the latex command can
    locate them, see the README file.

Note this shit:
Package ifplatform Warning: 
    shell escape is disabled, so I can only detect \ifwindows.

when trying to run pdftex, might need -shell-escape


Just learn how to use beamer and doconce
