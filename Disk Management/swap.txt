# Swap
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq

### For a separate swap partition
1. create with gparted
 - Linux-swap

2. Get UUID of /dev/yourswappartition
 - blkid or gparted information
d5f78aaa-fcdc-4be5-876b-6463a4bebed0
 - Can use path or UUID, but UUID stays consistent between boots

3. Tell Linux where to find the swap partition, modify /etc/fstab
 - Look for line with 'swap' in it

4. Activate
sudo swapon --all --verbose # didn't actually print anything

5. Confirm existence
cat /proc/swaps # printed two things until reboot

6. Reboot.

(Optional) Make work for hibernate

1. Open /etc/default/grub, modify such that
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="resume=UUID=234hUUIDofyourNewSwap"

2. Refresh
sudo update-grub

3. Modify /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume s.t. contents are:
resume=UUID=UUIDofYourNewSwap

4. Refresh
sudo update-initramfs -u # -u for already existing

Done.
To hibernate:
sudo systemctl hibernate

Since this doesn't work on all systems ( usually controllable causes),
is disabled. To enable in context menu, see hibernate.txt
