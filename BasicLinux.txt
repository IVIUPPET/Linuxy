Perhaps this should go elsewhere, but one can make functions to simplify this
https://askubuntu.com/questions/16106/how-can-i-create-an-alias-for-cd-and-ls

write into ~/.bashrc, a file that stores bash's configurations (has cool stuff in it)
function cs () {
    cd "$@" && ls
    }

then refresh
source ~/.bashrc
